# Test for [@react-three/uikit](https://github.com/pmndrs/uikit/tree/main)

## Installation
Install dependencies with the following command:
```bash
npm install --force
```
_The `force` tag is because `@react-three/uikit` has dependency conflicts_

## Start server
Run development environment
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Test
Try to drag the elements shown in the canvas. Only one element will be dragged. Drag event fires anywhere in the canvas.
